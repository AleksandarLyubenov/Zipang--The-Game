# Zipang the Game

This is a project made for the assessment in the Term 4 Course "Unity Scripting". It is one of my first fully fledged out 3D games made using Unity.

The theme is you are the modern Japan Maritime Self-Defence Force Destroyer DDG-173 JS Kongo, thrust into the past at the battle of Midway where you must choose which side to fight with, or fight them both to stay neutral.
